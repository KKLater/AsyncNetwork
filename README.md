# AsyncNetwork
AsyncNetwork is an asynchronous (Async) network request library that creates network requests for protocols and provides a distributed way to manage networks, making network requests faster and easier.

Using AsyncNetwork, you can easily create and manage network requests without worrying about the underlying network details. The library uses an asynchronous programming model, allowing you to write non-blocking code that does not block the main thread and can efficiently utilize system resources.

## [Installation](https://github.com/KKLater/AsyncNetwork#installation)

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/KKLater/AsyncNetwork#swift-package-manager)

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding AsyncNetwork as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/KKLater/AsyncNetwork.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
]
```
